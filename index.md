## Professional Interests

Broadly speaking, I am interested in statistical methods, social and cultural psychology, and the scholarship of teaching and learning. Of course, these interests are not mutually exclusive; in fact, most of my work spans more than one of these categories.

- **Statistics and Research Methods:** Confidence intervals; effect sizes; structural equation modeling; multilevel modeling
- **Social and Cultural Psychology:** Justice, fairness, and morality; social and political values; cultural and evolutionary psychology
- **Scholarship of Teaching and Learning:** Social psychology of education; student evaluations of teaching; faculty development
