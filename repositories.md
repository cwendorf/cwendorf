### [DEVISE](https://github.com/cwendorf/DEVISE)

**Data Exploration, Visualization, and Inference with Statistical Estimation**

`DEVISE` is an R package that implements features of estimation statistics and data visualization in a pipe-oriented framework. Its primary functions describe, estimate, test, and plot confidence intervals for means, mean comparisons, correlations, and standardized effect sizes in between- and within-subjects single-factor, factorial, and mixed designs. Most functions can take either raw data or summary statistics as input.

### [backcalc](https://github.com/cwendorf/backcalc)

**Reconstruct Missing Inferential Statistics**

`backcalc` is an R package that provides a set of functions to reconstruct key inferential statistics such as standard errors, confidence intervals, test statistics, and p-values from partial or incomplete summary information commonly reported in scientific literature. The functions support a variety of data types and designs, including single-sample, two-sample (independent or paired), one- and two-sided tests, and accommodate both z and t distributions.

### [spTools](https://github.com/cwendorf/spTools)

**Helper Functions for the `statpsych` Package**

`spTools` is a small collection of helper functions that enhance the usability, formatting, and interpretability of statistical results produced by the statpsych package by Douglas Bonett. `statpsych` provides high-accuracy confidence interval methods for means, medians, variances, proportions, correlations, and standardized effect sizes. However, its functions are designed in a traditional R programming style, making them less convenient for modern workflows involving the native pipe (|>) and other conventions.

### [CALM](https://github.com/cwendorf/CALM)

**Contrast Algorithms for Linear Models**

`CALM` is an R package for creating and interpreting contrast codes for linear models. It is an extension of the built-in contrast specifications in R and inspired by Venables's `codingMatrices` package, but it includes codes not available in other packages. In addition to providing contrast specifications, it includes functions for directly converting hypothesized differences (contrasts) into linear model codes (and vice versa).

### [polyPlot](https://github.com/cwendorf/polyPlot)

**Visualizing Distributional Statistics**

`polyPlot` is a small R package that offers a modified version of Seier and Bonett's (2011) polyplot, a visualization tool for various distributional summary statistics.

### [simplePipes](https://github.com/cwendorf/simplePipes)

**A Collection of Pipe Operators**

`simplePipes` is a small R package that implements a variety of simple pipe operators. It has less error checking than major R packages (like `magrittr` or `dplyr`) but contains more varieties -- both forward and backward versions of basic, tee, wye, exposition, compound assignment, and dot pipes -- and introduces the concept of through pipes. It also implements syntax that is simpler than the R native forward pipe.

### [BASE](https://github.com/cwendorf/BASE)

**Basic Analytical Statistics in Excel**

`BASE` a collection of Excel spreadsheets that provide real-time calculations and graphs of statistics for educational use. Taken together, these resources provide a simple -- yet quite effective -- system that can be used in any typical introductory statistics course and for basic data analyses.
