## OVerview

Participation in this directed study is designed to give the student the opportunity to be involved in the implementation of an empirical study in social/cultural psychology. The end-goal is for the student, with the instructor’s assistance, to collect and organize the data for the study.

## Learning Outcomes

PSYC 399 (Independent Study) has the following learning outcomes.

University Experiential Learning Outcomes: As an Experiential Learning course in the University’s General Education Program, students in this course will:

- Complete and approved experiential learning project.
- Reflect on the experiential learning project in order to gain further understanding of their university education, and an enhanced sense of one’s personal responsibility as a member of a larger community.

Departmental Learning Outcomes: In order to meet the objectives above, students in PSYC 399 will: 

- Use professional skills in Psychology to study, develop, implement, or apply research findings in everyday settings.
- Complete an oral or written reflection that describes what they have learned about themselves, their experiences, and Psychology in general as a result of the project.

## Expectations

When enrolled in PSYC 399, you will be expected to work about 3 hours per week for every credit enrolled.  You will be expected to do the following:

- Meet and Discuss the Assigned Readings: Background readings (i.e., either given by the instructor or selected by the student) will provide the student with the theoretical background necessary to understand the study and to create a research poster (or report). The student should be prepared to discuss and should contribute to the subsequent discussion of these articles in depth at the regularly scheduled meetings.
- Collect and Enter the Data: The student, in conjunction with the instructor and other students, is expected to: 1) be involved in the data collection as necessary, and 2) learn and perform the basic procedures of data entry.
- Complete the Paperwork and a Progress Report: The student is expected to complete all necessary paperwork (such as the IRB protocol) for conducting the study. The student is also expected to write a progress review about the project which should describe the basic topic of study (to demonstrate the student’s familiarity with the background of the study) and several observations about the study as a result of implementing the study.

## Grading

This directed study is graded and the final grade will be determined by the extent to which the student’s performance matches expectations.  The above areas (meetings and discussions, data collection and entry, and the paperwork) will be equally weighted.

The student’s grade will reflect the student’s contribution to these activities relative to the instructor’s and other students’ contributions to the same project. The student will be expected to complete a self-evaluation at the end of the semester, which the instructor will consider when determining the final grade.
