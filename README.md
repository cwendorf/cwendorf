## MY STATISTICS RESOURCES

I am interested in statistical methods quite generally. Currently, I focus on the development of resources in three overlapping areas of statistical methodology:

- **Statistics Education:** Educating students and the public about basic statistical procedures
- **Estimation Statistics:** Promoting confidence intervals and effect sizes as a framework for decision making
- **Data Visualization:** Adapting graphing procedures to better represent patterns in data
