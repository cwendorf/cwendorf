## MY STATISTICS RESEARCH

I am interested in statistical methods quite generally. Across my career, I have focused on three overlapping areas of statistical methodology:

- **Statistics Education:** Educating students and the public about basic and new statistical procedures
- **Estimation Statistics:** Promoting confidence intervals, contrasts, and effect sizes as a framework for decision making
- **Complex Data:** Modeling dyadic, multilevel, and longitudinal data

## MY STATISTICS RESOURCES

I create resources to support learning and doing statistics using three sets of tools:

- **Websites:** Step-by-step tutorials for statistical software like SPSS, jamovi, and JASP—designed to make analysis more approachable for learners
- **R Packages:** Custom R tools for teaching, effect size estimation, data visualization, and reproducible analysis—ideal for educators and researchers
- **Spreadsheets:** User-friendly templates that bring advanced statistical methods to Excel—great for teaching or quick analyses without coding
