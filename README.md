## MY STATISTICS RESEARCH

I am passionate about statistical methods and their application across education and research. My work focuses on three overlapping areas:

- **Statistics Education:** Educating students and the public on both fundamental and modern statistical procedures
- **Estimation Statistics:** Promoting the use of confidence intervals, contrasts, and effect sizes as a robust framework for decision making
- **Complex Data:** Developing and applying models for dyadic, multilevel, and longitudinal data in applied research settings

## MY STATISTICS RESOURCES

I develop tools and materials to support learning and applying statistics, spanning three main platforms:

- **Websites:** Step-by-step tutorials for software like SPSS, jamovi, and JASP designed to make statistical analysis approachable
- **R Packages:** Custom R packages for teaching, effect size estimation, data visualization, and reproducible research, tailored for educators and researchers
- **Spreadsheets:** User-friendly Excel templates that bring statistical methods to life for quick analyses and teaching purposes
