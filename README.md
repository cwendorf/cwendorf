I am interested in statistical methods quite generally. Currently, I focus on the development of tools to advance three overlapping areas in statistical methods:

- **Statistics Education:** Educating students and the public about basic statistical procedures.
- **Estimation Statistics:** Using confidence intervals and effect sizes as a framework for decision making.
- **Statistical Modeling:** Advancing structural equation, multilevel, and regression models for complex data.
