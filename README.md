I am interested in statistical methods quite generally. Currently, I focus on the development of tools to advance three overlapping areas in statistical methods:

- **Statistics Education:** A focus on educating students and the public about basic and advanced statistical procedures.
- **Estimation Statistics:** An emphasis on confidence intervals and effect sizes as a framework for improving statistical decision making.
- **General Statistical Modeling:** An interest in structural equation modeling, multilevel modeling, and multiple regression as methods for understanding complex data.
