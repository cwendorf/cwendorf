### [Sourcebook](https://github.com/cwendorf/Sourcebook)

**Basic Statistical Methods for Social Science**

 This online `Sourcebook` is intended to facilitate the connection between standard introductory statistics concepts and their implementation in statistical software. It contains a wide range of materials designed to assist with the use of statistical software such as IBM SPSS, jamovi, JASP, R (base functions), and DEVISE (an R package).

### [DEVISE](https://github.com/cwendorf/DEVISE)

**Data Exploration, Visualization, and Inference with Statistical Estimation**

`DEVISE` is an R package that implements features of estimation statistics and data visualization in a pipe-oriented framework. Its primary functions describe, estimate, test, and plot confidence intervals for means, mean comparisons, correlations, and standardized effect sizes in between- and within-subjects single-factor, factorial, and mixed designs. Most functions can take either raw data or summary statistics as input.

### [backcalc](https://github.com/cwendorf/backcalc)

**Reconstruct Missing Inferential Statistics**

`backcalc` is an R package that provides a set of functions to reconstruct key inferential statistics such as standard errors, confidence intervals, test statistics, and p-values from partial or incomplete summary information commonly reported in scientific literature. The functions support a variety of data types and designs, including single-sample, two-sample (independent or paired), one- and two-sided tests, and accommodate both z and t distributions.

### [CALM](https://github.com/cwendorf/CALM)

**Contrast Algorithms for Linear Models**

`CALM` is an R package for creating and interpreting contrast codes for linear models. It is an extension of the built-in contrast specifications in R and inspired by Venables's `codingMatrices` package, but it includes codes not available in other packages. In addition to providing contrast specifications, it includes functions for directly converting hypothesized differences (contrasts) into linear model codes (and vice versa).

### [polyPlot](https://github.com/cwendorf/polyPlot)

**Visualizing Distributional Statistics**

`polyPlot` is a small R package that offers a modified version of Seier and Bonett's (2011) polyplot, a visualization tool for various distributional summary statistics.

### [plotDistributions](https://github.com/cwendorf/plotDistributions)

**Visualizing Probability Distributions**

`plotDistributions` is a small R package for plotting the probability density and cumulative distribution functions for various continuous distributions. It provides functionality to highlight probabilities and display critical values.

### [simplePipes](https://github.com/cwendorf/simplePipes)

**A Collection of Pipe Operators**

`simplePipes` is a small R package that implements a variety of simple pipe operators. It has less error checking than major R packages (like `magrittr` or `dplyr`) but contains more varieties -- both forward and backward versions of basic, tee, wye, exposition, compound assignment, and dot pipes -- and introduces the concept of through pipes.

### [BASE](https://github.com/cwendorf/BASE)

**Basic Analytical Statistics in Excel**

`BASE` a collection of Excel spreadsheets that provide real-time calculations and graphs of statistics for educational use. Taken together, these resources provide a simple -- yet quite effective -- system that can be used in any typical introductory statistics course and for basic data analyses.
